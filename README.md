# RaygunTrello

Here's my code test submission.

## Setup
This solution was created in VS 2017 RC but I am informed that it should open in VS 2015 just fine. Just open the solution, download the nuget packages and run it, should be as simple as that. The solution has no backend persistence so that's all there is to it.

## Hours spent
 About 14 hours all up, I spent a little longer at the end removing some code smells and making it more elegant. The first iteration was about 11 hours.

 Cheers,

 Sam
